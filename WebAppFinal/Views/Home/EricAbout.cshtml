            <p>
            I am an IT Software Development major, I currently work in IT for a retail store doing a variety of tasks including Active Directory, making simple apps for the company
            to use, network management (configuring cisco / arista switches), VOIP management, monitoring infrastructure with Logic Monitor / Zabbix, and
            writing SQL views for the finance team to use in their Power BI reports.
            </p>
            <p>
            I enjoy spending time outdoors, some of my hobbies include riding dirt bikes, fishing, camping and shooting guns occasionally.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some of my indoor hobbies include: home labbing, I have a small home lab setup with 2 Cisco 3850 switches, 2 old optiplexs running a 2 node proxmox setup (I really 
            need a third node lol) a Mikrotik router and a unifi access point. I mostly use the home lab to stream from my Jellyfin media server, and to tinker with Redhat Linux VM's.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also enjoy playing Counter Strike 2, I've played counter strike for probably close to 10 years now, I used to play in tournaments, but I don't have time to do this
            anymore so I just play for fun on the weekends. Another all time favorite video game of mine is World of Warcraft. I started playing WoW when I was 10 years old or so
            and still play the game from time to time.
